The DRE is in fact a Python distribution that includes cmake, swig, Python, numpy, matplotlib, wxPython, gdcm, VTK, ITK and DeVIDE itself.
With the DRE, you can easily develop your own Python applications and also C++ extension modules, as the C++ SDK is included

2) Configure eclipse and PyDev 
Create a file dre.cmd in the installation DeVIDE directory
Copy in the drecmd the following content:
@echo off
